# Chapter 2: Sprint Planning & Execution

## 2.1 Overloading Sprints
- **Overcommit**: Ensure that the sprint backlog is overloaded with tasks that are impossible to complete within the sprint. This guarantees consistent sprint failures and demoralizes the team.
- **Complex Tasks**: Assign tasks that are too complex to be broken down into manageable sprint-sized chunks, such as large-scale architecture changes or comprehensive UI overhauls.

## 2.2 Ambiguous User Stories
- **Vague Acceptance Criteria**: Write user stories with unclear acceptance criteria. This ensures no one is entirely sure what "done" looks like.
- **Changing Requirements**: Frequently change requirements mid-sprint to disrupt the team's focus and workflow.

## 2.3 Inefficient Sprint Reviews
- **Extended Demo Times**: Ensure that sprint reviews involve long, detailed demonstrations of every minor change, regardless of its significance. This wastes time and bores stakeholders.
- **Unprepared Presentations**: Conduct sprint reviews with minimal preparation. This will lead to confusion and lack of constructive feedback.

## 2.4 Inconsistent Sprint Goals
- **Shifting Priorities**: Constantly change the sprint goals based on the latest whim of any stakeholder. This creates confusion and lack of direction for the team.
- **Undefined Objectives**: Start sprints without clear objectives or expected outcomes. This ensures the team has no real target to aim for.

## 2.5 Lack of Retrospective Action
- **No Follow-Up**: Hold retrospectives but never follow up on any of the action items. This ensures that the same issues continue to plague every sprint.
- **Blame Game**: Use retrospectives to point fingers and assign blame rather than to constructively identify and solve problems.

By following these satirical guidelines, you can effectively sabotage your sprint planning and execution processes, ensuring maximum inefficiency and frustration for your team. 
Happy sprinting!
