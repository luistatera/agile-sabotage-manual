## Introduction
Agile Software Development has revolutionized the way teams deliver value, promoting collaboration, flexibility, and continuous improvement. However, despite its widespread adoption, many teams struggle with common issues that hinder their productivity and effectiveness. This manual adopts a satirical approach, inspired by the "Simple Sabotage Field Manual" used during World War II, to underscore these challenges and provoke thoughtful reflection and change. By highlighting everyday inefficiencies humorously, we hope to inspire Agile teams to identify and overcome these obstacles, ultimately enhancing their Agile practices.
